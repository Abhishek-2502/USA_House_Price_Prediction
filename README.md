# House Price Prediction with AIML

This project utilizes Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) to predict house prices in the USA using a linear regression model. The model achieves an accuracy of 91% on the provided dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes the following features:

- Avg. Area Income: Average income of residents in the area
- Avg. Area House Age: Average age of houses in the area
- Avg. Area Number of Rooms: Average number of rooms in houses in the area
- Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms: Average number of bedrooms in houses in the area
- Area Population: Population of the area
- Price: Price of the house
- Address: Address of the house

## Methodology

Linear regression is employed to predict house prices based on the given features. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated on another portion to assess its accuracy. The training process involves optimizing the model parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and actual house prices.

## Accuracy

The accuracy of the linear regression model on the provided dataset is 91%. This indicates that the model can effectively predict house prices based on the given features.

## Usage

To utilize the trained model for predicting house prices, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the prediction script:

```bash
python predict_house_price.py
```

## Future Improvements

- Explore other machine learning algorithms to compare their performance with linear regression.
- Incorporate additional features that may improve prediction accuracy.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance further.
